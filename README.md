# Introduction
Glad to see you at this page! I trying hard to become a litle bit good programm maker.
I wrote many strings of code, fall, rise and continue coding. :triumph:
I'm really happy to present you my project. :relaxed:

# Solving square equations
  My project helps to solve square equations fast and without pain!  
  Equations like **376 * x^2 + 374508766 * x + 8597** scares many people.  
  Don't worry. Just enter 3 coefficients of your square equation and it will be solved.
# Using the programm
  To start solving equations you need to open file a.exe      
  Other way, you can open cmd and use **makefile** to build **a.exe**
 # Testing 
  To start testing you can open file **test.exe**  
  Other way, you can start testing with command make **test.exe**
